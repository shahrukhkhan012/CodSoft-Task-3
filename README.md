# ris-Flower-Classification
The Iris flower dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning, and in this project, I focused on building robust classifiers to distinguish the three different Iris species - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Key highlights of my project:

 Data Exploration: I thoroughly analyzed the Iris flower dataset, gaining insights into the distinctive features that set each species apart.

Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.

SVM Classification: I harnessed the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and versatile algorithm, to develop a sophisticated classifier capable of accurately predicting the Iris flower species.

Logistic Regression: Additionally, I explored the utility of Logistic Regression, a fundamental yet effective algorithm, and compared its performance with SVM.

Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of both SVM and Logistic Regression models was carried out using appropriate metrics to gauge their accuracy and generalization capabilities.

The main goal of this project was to showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of SVM and Logistic Regression in the context of flower classification, contributing to the advancement of machine learning techniques.
